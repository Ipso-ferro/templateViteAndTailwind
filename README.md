## ⚠️ Before You Start

Setting up environments can sometimes fail due to:

- Outdated `Node.js` versions (recommended: **v18+**)
- OS permission issues or missing dependencies
- Tailwind or PostCSS version mismatches

Make sure you:

- Use a recent version of **Node.js**
- Run `npm install` in the root directory
- Check for version updates if the dev server doesn't run
